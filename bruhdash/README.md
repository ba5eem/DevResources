# bruhdash
bruhdash is an exercise in more advanced JavaScript Array scenarios using the basics Array methods that you have already learned.

_It is your job to implment your first library. Bruh._

###Setup:

####Install live-server:
`npm install -g live-server`

You will need to do your work in the browser by starting live-server in your terminal:

`$ live-server`

...which will allow you to use your browser to load your libary at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


###Workflow
__Important:__ Using the browser debugging techniques we showed you must set breakpoints to inspect your functions as you work through the challenge and test your functions by calling them in the console window.

###Implementation Requirements:
Implement the following methods in the library stub provided and implement the following methods from the popular _lodash_ utility library(don't call it a framework).

Implement the following methods to show your new Array chops:

[first(array)](https://lodash.com/docs#first)

[last(array)](https://lodash.com/docs#last)

[indexOf(array, value, [fromIndex=0])](https://lodash.com/docs#indexOf)

[lastIndexOf(array, value, [fromIndex=array.length-1])](https://lodash.com/docs#lastIndexOf)

[initial(array)](https://lodash.com/docs#initial)

[compact(array)](https://lodash.com/docs#compact)

[slice(array, [start=0], [end=array.length])](https://lodash.com/docs#slice)

[drop(array, [n=1])](https://lodash.com/docs#drop)

[dropRight(array, [n=1])](https://lodash.com/docs#dropRight)

[take(array, [n=1])](https://lodash.com/docs#take)

[takeRight(array, [n=1])](https://lodash.com/docs#takeRight)

[fill(array, value, [start=0], [end=array.length])](https://lodash.com/docs#fill)

[pull(array, [values])](https://lodash.com/docs#pull)

[pullAt(array, [indexes])](https://lodash.com/docs#pullAt)
