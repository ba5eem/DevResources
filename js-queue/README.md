# The Queue Datastructure

We will be creating a **module** that helps us generate a **Queue Class** in the **Node environment**. A queue is a data structure in which the first element is inserted from one end called REAR (also called tail), and the deletion of existing element takes place from the other end called as FRONT (also called head).  This makes queue a FIFO (first in first out), or the element that is inserted first will always be the first to be removed.

## Methods

### size()
Returns the size of the queue

### enqueue(item)
Adds an item to the top of the queue structure

### pop()
Takes an item off the top of the queue and returns the item.

### peek()
Returns the first item in line to be removed without removing it. If there are
no items in the queue, return null
