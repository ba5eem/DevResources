# js-fundamentals-drills

This is an exercise repo with 40 different drills to practice writing functions, loops, array and object access.

## Pre-Requisites

* A personal GitHub account
* [Visual Studio Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-all)

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your own Github account.
1. Clone down the forked repo from your Github account to your local development environment.
1. In the project directory on your local machine, install all the npm modules with `npm install`.
1. Your answers should go in the `exercises.js` file.
1. After you are done with each function, check if the tests pass by entering `npm test` in the terminal.

## Notes:
1. After each function is done, make sure to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the exercise page and replace 'null' with the corresponding function name.  This way the test runner will have access to the function you just wrote!
