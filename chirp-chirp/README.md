# Recursion Exercise

## Chirp

### Getting started
* Run `live-server`
* Open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/chirp.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/chirp.html)
* Edit `js/chirp.js`
* Make your tests pass :tada:

#### Notes
- Define a function named chirp() that takes a single argument 'n'
- Calling chirp(3) will return the text "chirp chirp chirp"
- chirp will call itself, each time returning "chirp "


## Letter counter

### Getting started
* Run `live-server`
* Open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/letters.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/letters.html)
* Edit `js/letters.js`
* Make your tests pass :tada:

#### Notes
- Define a function named countLetters() that takes two arguments 'counter' and 'text'
- Calling countLetters(counter, sample_text) will populate the counter object with a count of how many times letters occur
- countLetters will call itself until all letters are counted
