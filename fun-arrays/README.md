# Fun Arrays

## Functional Array method exercise

Read the instructions which are comments in the file: `array-methods.js`, e.g.

```javascript
/*
  create an array with accounts from bankBalances that are
  greater than 100000.00
  assign the resulting array to `hundredThousandairs`
*/

var hundredThousandairs = null;
```

Fulfill the requirements using iterative Array methods.

## THE DATA `dataset.json`
`bankBalances` holds a collection of data. At each position is an object with an `amount` and `state` property. Each of these objects represent a bank in a state. a State can have multiple banks which may be represented in the collection.

## Caveats

DO NOT MUTATE THE ORIGINAL DATA.
