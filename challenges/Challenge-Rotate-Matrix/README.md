Matrix Rotator
===========

Write the **rotate** method of the **MatrixRotator** class that accepts one argument, **direction**.
**rotate** must set the object's **matrix** property with a new, rotated matrix.

Rotating a matrix clockwise will rotate every element to it's clockwise position.

example matrix rotation:
original
```
a b c
d e f
g h i
```

rotated clockwise (_CW_)
```
g d a
h e b
i f c
```

rotated clockwise (_CW_) once more
```
i h g
f e d
c b a
```
