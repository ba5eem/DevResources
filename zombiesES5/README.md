### Help

See help with class construction, parameters, properties, and inheritence in
[https://github.com/devleague/js-zombies/blob/master/doc/oop-example.pdf](/doc/oop-example.pdf)

When instructed to call the super class, use the `Function.prototype.call` method.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call

```
// SUPER CLASS
function Item(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// SUB CLASS
function Weapon(name, damage) {
  this.damage = damage;
  Item.call(this, name); // Call super class
}
```

To extend the super class, use the `Object.create` method introduced in
https://github.com/devleague/oop-factory-example

```
// EXTEND SUPER CLASS
Weapon.prototype = Object.create(Item.prototype, {
  constructor: {
    value: Item
  }
});
```

----

### checkPack()
*Player checks the contents of their pack.*

Nicely format and print the items in the player's pack.
To access the pack, be sure to use Player's `getPack` method.
You should be able to invoke this function on a Player instance.

----

### takeItem(item)
*Player takes an item from the world and places it into their pack.*

Player's pack can only hold a maximum of 3 items, so if they try to add more than that, return false.
Before returning true or false, print a message containing the player and item names if successful.
Otherwise, print a message saying that the pack is full so the item could not be stored.
Note: The player is allowed to store similar items (items with the same name).
You should be able to invoke this function on a Player instance.

**Parameters**
`item`: Item/Weapon/Food, The item to take.

**Returns**: boolean, Whether player was able to store item in pack.

----

### discardItem(item)
*Player discards an item from their pack.*

Use Array's `indexOf` method to check if the pack contains the item.
If an item is not found in the pack, indexOf returns -1.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf

If the item is in the pack, remove it from the pack using Array's `splice` method.
Note: The splice method can also be used for array element replacement.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
Then print the player and item names and a message saying the item was discarded.
Return true for the successful discard.

If the item is not in the pack, return a message with the item name saying nothing was discarded since the item could not be found.  Return false in this case.

You should be able to invoke this function on a Player instance.

**Parameters**
`item`: Item/Weapon/Food, The item to discard.

**Returns**: boolean, Whether player was able to remove item from pack.

----

### equip(itemToEquip)
*Player equips a weapon item.*

Player can only equip Weapon instances.

If the player already has a weapon equipped (the `equipped` property is set to an Item), find the itemToEquip in the pack and replace it with the currently equipped item.  Then set the equipped property to the itemToEquip.

However, if the player has nothing equipped, simply equip itemToEquip and remove it from the pack.
You should be able to invoke this function on a Player instance.

**Parameters**
`itemToEquip`: Weapon, The weapon item to equip.

----

### eat(itemToEat)
